Installation
============

I recommend you use ``pip``. Just do

    pip install git+https://github.com/SebastianBocquet/MiraTitanUniverseHMFemulator

To make sure nothing bad has happened you should then test the installation:

    cd /path/to/MiraTitanUniverseHMFemulator
    pytest

This should take 10-15 seconds and should confirm that you are all set. I
suggest you now run the ``tutorial.ipynb`` notebook to familiarize yourself with
the emulator.
