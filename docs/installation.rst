============
Installation
============

I recommend you use ``pip``. Just do::

  pip install git+https://github.com/SebastianBocquet/MiraTitanUniverseHMFemulator

To make sure nothing bad has happened you should then test the installation::

  cd /path/to/MiraTitanUniverseHMFemulator
  pytest

This should take 10-15 seconds and should confirm that you are all set. I
suggest you now checkout out the `tutorial notebook
<https://github.com/SebastianBocquet/MiraTitanUniverseHMFemulator/tutorial.ipynb>`_
to familiarize yourself with the emulator.
